    - The testRemove method fails. 
TestList.Java Questions
// TODO Question: Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
    - No Difference
list.remove(5); // TODO Question: What does this method do?
    - It remove the value that is at index 5
list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // TODO Question: What does this one do?
    - It removes the integer 5
TestPerformance.Java Questions
TODO Question: What conclusions can you draw about the performance of LinkedList vs. ArrayList when
// comparing their running times for AddRemove vs. Access? Record those running times in README.txt!

ArrayList Time: 419, 357, 368, 411
LinkedList Time: 433, 282, 375, 350

Based on these test we can say that the run time is faster on Linked List.
